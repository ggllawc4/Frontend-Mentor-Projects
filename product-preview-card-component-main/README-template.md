## My process

### Built with

- Built with HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to use media queries to control the display of an image within a div, making it responsive across different screen sizes.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: none;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue my development in CSS box model, positioning, and media queries.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped in understanding box model and positioning. I really liked this and will use it going forward.\

- [Fed Mentor.Dev](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/padding-margin/) - This blog helped me in understanding padding and margin. I really liked this and will use it going forward.
